                       Barcleona is one of my favorite soccer clubs to exist. They have great players that play in different positions. For example, Lionel Messi is one of the greatest left wingers to ever play soccer. Every position in the team has a great player assigned to that position.

                       Juventus has many great players on the team. They recently had Ronaldo transferred to the team which has made the team an unstoppable force. It made me kind of upset that Ronaldo is kind of taking the spotlight, yet I am not as upset as other fans of the team.

                        Paris Saint Germain is my fourth favorite soccer team. They have two really good players. Those two players are Mbappe and Neymar Jr. I really like these two players and the team overall because of how strong they are even if their team has big flaws.

                        Real Madrid is team that has had its up and downs. They lost one of their greatest players, which was Ronaldo. Yet they still go on trying their hardest. This makes me admire them even more than I already did.
