                       Destiny is easily one of my favorite games I have ever played. You may have read about this game in the about me section. It was so fun to play through the game and earn great loot. the best feeling was getting cool armor or weapons and take to fight other players online

                      Black ops 2 is my favorite game of the Black Ops franchise. Sure some of the other games that were made could be good, but Black Ops 2 had the best gameplay for zombies and multiplayer. It was just so much fun to get on and play this game with your friends

                        Destiny 2 was f=definetely not as good as Destiny 1. They could have done better and should have honestly kept the mechanics the same. Yet the game is still good. They had some screw ups with the new content that was released, but they are slowly patching the game up. They are actually listening to the community and deciding to fix whatever the players propose to fix.
