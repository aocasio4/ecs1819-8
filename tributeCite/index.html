                            Jesse Jackson was part of Martin Luther King jr's Southern Christian Leadership Conference
                            Jesse Jackson was inspired by Martin Luther King Jr because of how hard Martin Luther King Jr worked to obtain peace and equality.

                                      Jesse Jackson hasn't really inspired or was inspired by Bill Clinton, but he was really close to Bill Clinton during his time in the office. Jesse Jackson has really helped Bill Clinton and he was even awarded the  Presidential Medal of Freedom.

                                Like before, this isn't ecxactly an influencer or someone he influenced, but I couldn't find anyone else. T.M.R was a major supporter of Jesse Jackson. He thought that Jesse Jackson was doing a great thing and eventually donated and raised funds
